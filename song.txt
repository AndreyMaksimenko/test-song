[Verse 1]
You walk along the edge of danger
And it will change you
Why would you let this voice set in your head?
It is meant to destroy you
You summon storms, you play with nature
Now watch it hurt you
Why would you want to shape the world in your hands?
You will never make it through

[Pre-Chorus]
Bey'fet ihru ga, Ahuni lek'cho (Suhbi al naa yih)
Bey'un hahbab, Ahuni lek'cho (Suhbi al naa yih)

[Chorus]
Catch the fire burning out your soul
(Suhbi al naa yih, suhbi al naa yih)
Just make it die or you will turn it all

[Post-Chorus]
To ashes and blood
(Bey'fet ihru ga, Ahuni lek'cho)
To ashes and blood
(Bey'un hahbab, Ahuni lek'cho)

[Verse 2]
You waste your life to gain power
You shift the game rules
How does it feel to reach the line that no one ever got to cross?
Does it make you a god now?
Every sin will be forgiven
If you lay down your weapons to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Bey'fet ihru ga, Ahuni lek'cho
Bey'un hahbab, Ahuni lek'cho

[Chorus]
Catch the fire burning out your soul
Bey'fet ihru ga, Ahuni lek'cho (Suhbi al naa yih)
Just make it die or you will fall
Bey'un hahbab, Ahuni lek'cho (Suhbi al naa yih)
Catch the fire burning out your soul
Bey'fet ihru ga, Ahuni lek'cho (Suhbi al naa yih)
Just make it die or you will turn it all
Bey'un hahbab, Ahuni lek'cho

[Post-Chorus]
To ashes and blood
Bey'fet ihru ga, Ahuni lek'cho (Suhbi al naa yih)
To ashes and blood
Bey'un hahbab, Ahuni lek'cho (Suhbi al naa yih)
To ashes and blood
Bey'fet ihru ga, Ahuni lek'cho (Suhbi al naa yih)
To ashes and blood
Bey'un hahbab, Ahuni lek'cho
To ashes and blood
